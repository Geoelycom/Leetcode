### Cron Special Characters

| Symbol | Description | Examples |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| * | For every time unit | '*' in the <minute> field means "for every minute" |
| ? | Used in the <day-of-month> and <day-of-week> fields to denote the arbitrary value | '?' in the <day-of-week> field means "any week day" |
| – | Determines the value range | 10-15 in the <hour> field means "between 10th and 15th hours" |
| , | Specifies multiple values | "MON, WED, FRI" in <day-of-week> field means on the days "Monday, Wednesday and Friday" |
| / | Defines the incremental values | "5/15" in the <minute> field means "5, 20, 35, and 50 minutes of an hour" |
| L | Used in the <day-of-month> and <day-of-week> fields, indicates the last day of the month or last occurrence | 'L' in <day-of-month> – the last day of the month<br>'L-3' in <day-of-month> – Third to last day<br>'5L' in <day-of-week> – Last Friday |
| W | Used in the <day-of-month> field to specify the nearest weekday | "10W" in <day-of-month> – weekday near to 10th:<br>- Saturday 10th → runs Friday 9th<br>- Sunday 10th → runs Monday 11th<br>- Weekday 10th → runs 10th |
| # | Specifies the "N-th" occurrence of a weekday of the month | "5#3" in <day-of-week> – Third Friday<br>"1#2" in <day-of-week> – Second Monday |


### Cron Special Strings
In addition to the fields specified in the cron expression, there’s also support for some special, predefined values that we can use instead of the fields:

* @reboot – run once at system startup
* @yearly or @annualy – run once a year
* @monthly – run once a month
* @weekly – run once a week
* @daily or @midnight – run once a day
* @hourly – run hourly


### Working With Crontab
A cron schedule is a simple text file located under /var/spool/cron/crontabs on Linux systems. We cannot edit a crontab file directly, so we need to access it using the crontab -e command:

`crontab -e`

This opens the file for editing.

Each line in crontab is an entry with an expression and a command to run:

`* * * * * /usr/local/ispconfig/server/server.sh`

This entry runs the mentioned script every single minute.

### Cron Permissions
Ensure to set proper permissions for your system’s cron files to allow the jobs to run. You can create or edit two files to set the permissions – cron.allow and cron.deny.

If `/etc/cron.allow` exists, it should contain a username permitted to run the cron job automation. However, if your system has `/etc/cron.deny` containing a username, that account can’t use cron.
