// The Postgres Database System Architecture: this consist of the following: the server and the front end client. The server is the main component of the Postgres database system. It is responsible for managing the database, processing queries, and handling client connections. The server is composed of several components, including the query processor, the storage manager, the transaction manager, and the security manager. The front end client is the interface that users interact with to access the database. It provides a way for users to submit queries, view results, and manage the database.

// The Postgres Database System Components: The Postgres database system is composed of several components that work together to manage the database. These components include the query processor, the storage manager, the transaction manager, the security manager, and the front end client. The query processor is responsible for parsing and optimizing queries, the storage manager is responsible for managing the storage of data on disk, the transaction manager is responsible for managing transactions and ensuring data consistency, the security manager is responsible for managing user access and permissions, and the front end client is the interface that users interact with to access the database.

// Creating a database

// To create a new database in Postgres, you can use the CREATE DATABASE statement. Here's an example:


// create mydb;


// This will create a new database called mydb. You can also specify additional options when creating a database, such as the owner of the database, the character set, and the collation. Here's an example:


// create database
// mydb
// owner myuser
// encoding 'UTF8'
// lc_collate 'en_US.UTF-8'
// lc_ctype 'en_US.UTF-8';


// This will create a new database called mydb with the specified options
fn main () {
