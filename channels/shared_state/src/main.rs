// MUTEX = mutual exclusive
// Mutexes have a reputation for being difficult to use because you have to remember two rules:

// You must attempt to acquire the lock before using the data.
// When youâ€™re done with the data that the mutex guards, you must unlock the data so other threads can acquire the lock.
